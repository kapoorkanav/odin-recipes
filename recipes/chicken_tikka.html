        Description
    </h3>
    <p>
        Chicken Tikka is a popular Indian dish made by marinating bite-sized pieces of chicken in a spiced yogurt mixture and then grilling or baking them to perfection. The marinade typically includes spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala, along with lemon juice and fresh ginger-garlic paste. The result is a smoky, flavorful dish with a slightly charred exterior and a tender, juicy interior. Chicken Tikka can be served as an appetizer, a side dish, or the base for Chicken Tikka Masala when cooked in a creamy tomato sauce.
