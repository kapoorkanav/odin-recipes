        Description
    </h3>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, rich sauces, and savory fillings. Typically, it features alternating layers of marinara or béchamel sauce, seasoned ground meat or vegetables, and a blend of cheeses such as ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. The dish is baked in the oven until the layers meld together, creating a hearty and flavorful casserole with a golden, bubbly top. While the traditional recipe often includes beef or pork, vegetarian and seafood variations are also popular. Lasagna is loved worldwide for its comforting taste and versatility, making it a centerpiece of many family dinners and gatherings.
